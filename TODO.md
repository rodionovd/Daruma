1. user must be able to reopen the browser window once it's closed
    1.1. don't terminate the app after last window is closed
    1.2. automatically open a new window when the app has a focus? Yeah, I love cmd+tab so much
2. collection view background view?
    2.1. CocoaSlideCollection demo has it — why?
3. copy the default feels database into Application Support, then use this copy so a user could make changes (add/delete emoticons, assign lables, etc)
    3.1. only copy the file if it's not there already
4. Highlight emoticons on selection. Border or text color?
5. maybe use custom font for emoticons? Figure out what looks better
6. single clicking (without any modifier keys pressed) on an already selected item should deselect any other selected items, so only the current item will remain selected (like in Finder)
7. SEARCH EVERYTHING
    7.1. random search placeholder on every launch for lulz
8. SCROLL LAGS
    (Seems like it's not my fault, but I'd better optimize things before shipping into a wild)
9. drag'n'drop emoticons (from the app) as text
10. accessibility? I'heard of a book on the topic @ kickstarter…
11. gosh, app icon!
------------------- THE RELEASE LINE ---------------------
12. Provide user with a way to assign/change lables to emoticons. Search by these lables as well as by category name.
13. Double click on emoticon to copy it? With animation? Yes, please!
14. ADD NEW EMOTICONS
    14.1. via drag’n’drop (into app)?
    14.2. batch mode?
