1. Fill with actual emoticons
7. SEARCH EVERYTHING
    7.1. random search placeholder on every launch for lulz
    7.2. users enter some text in the search bar, press "enter": in the collection view are the results and the first item in these results is already selected (and in focus) for copy;
    7.3. search by both label and section name
XX. Get rid of FIXMEs and TODOs in the codebase
------------------- THE RELEASE LINE ---------------------
2. collection view background view?
    2.1. CocoaSlideCollection demo has it — why?
3. copy the default feels database into Application Support, then use this copy so a user could make changes (add/delete emoticons, assign lables, etc)
    3.1. only copy the file if it's not there already
4. tab order?
    4.1. pressing arrow key should select the first cell (if there was no selection before)
5. maybe use custom font for emoticons? Figure out what looks better
8. SCROLL LAGS????
    (Seems like it's not my fault, but I'd better optimize things before shipping into a wild)
10. accessibility? I'heard of a book on the topic @ kickstarter…
12. Provide user with a way to assign/change lables to emoticons. Search by these lables as well as by category name.
13. Double click on emoticon to copy it? With animation? Yes, please!
14. ADD NEW EMOTICONS
    14.1. via drag’n’drop (into app)?
    14.2. batch mode?
15. Rounded top corners of the collection view (?)
16. hotkeys for EVERYTHING HELL YEAH. (۶ꈨຶꎁꈨຶ )۶ʸᵉᵃʰᵎ
    cmd+n to create a thing, delete to delete, enter to change lables/modify emoticons, etc
17. Generate OS X Text Replacements for selected emoticons (e.g. "shrugg" -> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)
18. Shift-driven selections
19. Rearrange emoticons? with animation (e.g. Springboard)?
20. User should be able to change emoticons font size via both menu items and cmd+/cmd-
    20.1. Oh-oh-oh, we can also use a «magnification» gesture on the collection view for this!
