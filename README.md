# Daruma
### Discover japanese emoticons on a Mac

Daruma (達磨) is a Japanese traditional doll modeled after Bodhidharma, the founder of the Zen sect of Buddhism.

But it is also a Mac app for browsing hundreds of japanese emoticons *(aka kaomoji or dongers)*. Daruma allows you to search for emoticons by their labels, copy them to the clipboard or just drag’n’drop into other applications like Safari or Messages and many more!
